/**
 * The SFTP channels on one shared SSH connection. Opening a channel takes
 * about 3 round trips (channel open, subsystem request, SFTP init), so a
 * channel that's done with gives it back here for the next user.
 * <p>
 * A channel is only ever with one user: borrow() hands it out and removes it
 * from the pool, and it comes back only through {@link PooledSftpChannel#close()},
 * which returns it only if it's still open, nothing on it failed, and
 * everything opened on it was closed.
 * <p>
 * <b>The limit.</b> At most maxChannels channels are open at once, busy and
 * idle together, plus the slots taken by {@link #reserveSlot()} for commands:
 * servers limit them (OpenSSH: 10 per connection, MaxSessions). When all are
 * in use, borrow() waits up to waitMs for one to come back, then fails with
 * an IOException that says so, instead of the server refusing the channel.
 * <p>
 * <b>Streams can't starve calls.</b> Streams, random-access files and
 * seekable streams ({@link Use#STREAM}) may hold at most maxChannels - 2
 * channels. Single calls ({@link Use#CALL}: stat, list, mkdir...) may use
 * them all. A call holds its channel for one request and never borrows
 * another meanwhile, so calls always finish, even while every thread holding
 * a stream is waiting on a call.
 * <p>
 * At most MAX_IDLE channels are kept idle. A channel idle for longer than
 * MAX_IDLE_NANOS is closed the next time the pool is used. close() closes the
 * idle channels; the factory calls it when the last factory lets go of the
 * connection.
