/**
 * Positional reads and writes on an open MINA handle.
 * <p>
 * A read after a seek is one request, answered before the next is sent.
 * Once reads move forward (each starts where the last one ended), they come
 * from MINA's pipelined reader on the same handle instead, which keeps
 * several requests in flight, so a sequential pass doesn't wait one round
 * trip per chunk. The reader asks for at most READ_AHEAD_START bytes; each
 * time those are used up it's reopened with twice as many, up to
 * READ_AHEAD_MAX. That bounds the data thrown away when it's closed early.
 * <p>
 * The reader is closed on a seek, a write, a truncate (its data may be out
 * of date), at the end of the file (so a file that grows is seen), and on
 * close. Writes and truncates are one request each, and the read after one
 * is a single request again, so reading and writing in turn doesn't fetch
 * data ahead only to throw it away.
